Mash is an object shell for Linux.

## Features

* Object-based data model and shell language
* Tab completion for files, functions, methods, etc.
* Syntax colouring
* Tabular object pretty-printing
* Built-in function/method documentation

## Screenshots

Sequences of objects are displayed in tabular format:

Mash supports context sensitive tab completions:

![Context-sensitive tab completions]({{ site.url }}/assets/pic2.png){: .center-image }

## Caveat

The current implementation of Mash is an experimental proof-of-concept, and is likely to
change drastically. Feedback is very welcome, as would be collaborators in taking Mash
forward.
